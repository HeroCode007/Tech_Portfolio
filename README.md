Mobile‑first, accessible UI using Tailwind utility classes and custom theming.

Clean React structure with components, pages, and hooks for scalability.

Getting started
bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
These scripts follow Vite’s standard workflow for development and production.

Project structure
text
.
├─ src/                # components, pages, hooks, assets
├─ index.html          # Vite entry
├─ vite.config.*       # Vite config
├─ tailwind.config.*   # Tailwind theme/config
├─ postcss.config.*    # Tailwind/PostCSS pipeline
└─ dist/               # generated on build
Vite uses index.html as the app entry and emits production assets to dist.

Deployment
Any static host works: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3/CloudFront, etc.

Prefer CI to build on push; otherwise upload the contents of dist to the host.

Customize
Edit tailwind.config.* to change colors, fonts, and breakpoints.

Add Open Graph tags and metadata in index.html for rich previews.

Contributing
Issues and PRs are welcome; include steps to reproduce and screenshots when applicable.
